These codes are written in python3, and dependent on numpy, scipy, matplotlib.
Change to each directory and run codes by "bash exec.sh". Simulated results and figures will be saved in the same directory.
Mutual informations in Fig.3 and Fig.5 are saved in "MI.csv" in each directory. We manually collected and plotted those values after performing simulations several times.
